# Logic and Approach to Solving the Problem

**Logic:** Itinerary to be created on the basis of user preferences like destination, duration, budget, and group size. 

**The flow of logic involves:**

**User Authentication:** Users log in via Google SSO, ensuring secure access and personalized experiences.

**Input Gathering:** Users input their travel preferences. The place input is assisted by AI for accuracy and ease.

**Data Processing:** The preferences are passed to the Google Gemini API, which processes the data and generates an itinerary. The API response is stored in the Firebase database.

**Itinerary Generation:** The application retrieves the itinerary data, including images and location details from the Google Maps Places API, to display a detailed and visually appealing itinerary.

# Additional Features & Effectiveness

- Users can revisit their searched places.
- Users can share the generated itinerary on social media platforms like WhatsApp and X (Twitter).
- The webapp is responsive and can be operated from mobile as well. Thus making it both mobile & desktop friendly.
- Users can click on the image cards generated on the itinerary to directly open the Google Maps and navigate from there.

The solution effectively meets the challenge by providing a seamless user experience from login to itinerary generation. It leverages AI for intelligent suggestions and APIs for real-time data, ensuring that the itinerary is both accurate and personalized. The ability to share the itinerary enhances user engagement, making the application more dynamic and interactive.
